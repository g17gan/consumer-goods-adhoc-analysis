3. Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and sort them in descending order of product counts. The final output contains 2 fields,
                                                        segment
                                                        product_count

SOLUTION:-

SELECT 
	COUNT(DISTINCT product_code) AS product_cnt,
    segment
FROM dim_product
GROUP BY segment
ORDER BY product_cnt DESC;
